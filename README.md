# OpenCV-sky-compass
By using time, sun, and dataset of azimuth for current location, the program determines the user's compass orientation

On going improvments for projcet
- Recognize suns location when not in picture and from cloud obstruction
- ML dataset that predicts azimuth value at current time and GPS location to eliminate the use of external dataset.
